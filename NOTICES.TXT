The Zawgyi-One Font: Version 3.14
 Zawgyi-One is a curious font; its copyright belongs to Zawgyi.net and Alpha Mandalay.
 However, it is distributed with no licensing information, and is thus classified and 
 redistributable under the terms of license-free software. The Zawgyi.net website has
 stated in a front-page article that Zawgyi-One is and will always be free. 
 The Ornagai Mobile project sees fonts like Zawgyi-One as an enabling technology, and 
 sees no legal need to request special permission to embed or redistribute such fonts, 
 so long as credit is duly given and links to the latest versions of such fonts are 
 provided. We would encourage members of the Alpha Myanmar team to contact us directly 
 if they have any questions or requests.
